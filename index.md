Interested in software development and everything that comes with it? I am a software engineer who is interested in new technologies and different software development methods. Here I'll post different articles about things I discovered and think are worth sharing. As you can see in the menu, I also have a section with notes. Here I put stuff that I want to keep, but be free to use the information I post there.

I am Steven Gerritsen from the Netherlands and hope you got something useful from all the stuff I posted here. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.
