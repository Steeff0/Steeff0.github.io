Hello I'm Steven, a software developer from the Netherlands. I created this site to keep track of notes I want to keep, projects I want to talk about, information I want to share and just for playing around. You can read more about me on the [About]({% link pages/about.md %}) page. As time goes on, I'll add more content, but for now, this is it. I understand if you want to leave now, but come back soon for more interesting articles.
