**Senior developer | Kadaster**  
*02-01-2018 - Till Date*

Kadaster (Land Registry and Mapping Agency) changed their strategy toward providing their services digitally. They offer their products via more online channels and want to improve their contact with the customer. The websites of the Kadaster has to make it possible to let the customer quickly and easily order their products. The DevOps-/Scrum team where Steven is part of, is responcible for developing and maintaining the webshop and the web portal platform (Liferay).

In this team Steven is a Full Stack developer, who focuses on the development of new Liferay components with which the web redaction team can realize the different websites Kadaster owns. For this he mainly uses Java, Groovy, REST, Sass and Typescript.
