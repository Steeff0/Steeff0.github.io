* Stop, 
* Continue.

* Stop doing,  
* Keep doing.

### Sail boat
This Sail boat consists of:
* Goal & Dream,
* Risks & Threats
* Prosperity & Windfalls,
* Adversity & Setbacks.

You can use this [Poster](retro-files/Retro_Sail_boat.png) in Dutch.

### Superhero retro
#### Part 1: What is your superpower
Ask the people to write their superpower, they add to the team, on a sticky note and in short explain it.

#### Part 2: Superhero's in the spring
What was:
* [Liked] Super(man)
* [Disliked] Bad(man)
* [Learned] (doctor)Strange
* [Longed for] (didn't you) Dare(devil)

You can use this [Poster](retro-files/Retro_Superhero.pdf).

#### Part 3: Team Superpowers
Ask the team to write down what they think is the superpower of the team.

## Skills
### Tip & Top
1. Make a circle, and point out one person. 
1. Everyone else has to give the pointed out person, one Tip and tel about one thing he thinks is Top. 
1. After everyone had told something to this person, go to the next, until everyone received a Tip and a Top.

### Team knowledge graph
1. Write down the different knowledge area you think the team should have (eg backend, javascript, styling, testing).
1. Define when you are average in each skill
1. Then let everyone for themselves decide what skill they contain for every area (Jedi Master, Jedi Sentinel, Jedi Knight, Initiate)
1. Look at the overview and decide what knowledge-gabs there are in the team (or where there is a thin coverage).
1. Then let everyone decide what area they wat to grow in (Padawan).
1. Talk about these apprenticeships to decide how the team can facilitate it for everyone.

## Personal
### M&Ms retro
Take a bag of M&M's and let one person take an M&M and the color decides what question he has to answer. When answered it's the next persons turn. 
For example questions look: [M&M questions](retro-m-m-questions.md)

### Guess my favorite song
http://www.funretrospectives.com/guess-my-favorite-song/
1. Ask each participant to write their favorite song (please ask then to use uppercase and good handwriting to keep it anonymous).
1. Collect the notes in a container.
1. Shake it and leave the container on the center of the room.
1. Ask one participant walk to the container, collect a note, read the song name out loudly and try guessing whose favorite song it is.
1. Optionally, the facilitator should find the song (spotify or similar) and play it for the group.

### Retro Questions
For this retrospective, prepare an envelope, box or bag with different questions for the team. We have [example questions](retro-files/Retro_Questions.pdf) in Dutch.

Let everyone sit in a circle and give the envelope with questions to the first person. He has to pick a question blindly and answer it. Then give the envelope to the next person to do the same. You can discus the answers if people are interested in a Why or What. Keep going round till everyone has answered a question a couple of times, or the time is up.

## Improvements
### Well & Worries
http://www.funretrospectives.com/hopes-and-concerns/

Write down what you like about the (sprint, team, products) and what worries you about it (Can also be done with Hopes & Concerns).
1. Draw a vertical line on a canvas separating it on two sides with the titles as WELL & WORRIES
1. Ask the participants to write down on a post-it what we do Well and Worries them for the given sprint/team/products?
1. Group conversation about the notes

### The Aggregation of Marginal Gains (1% improvement)
"Success is a few simple disciplines, practiced every day; while failure is simply a few errors in judgment, repeated every day."
1. Let everyone write down ideas how to improve the team with 1%
1. Discuss each one to make clear what kind of effect it could have
1. Let everyone vote for what improvement we can implement next sprint

### Technical dept priority
1. (If it's not the first time add the previous technical dept items and discuss if there are items to be removed)
1. Let everyone write down other technical depts that were created last sprint(s)
1. Let each person give 3 points to the depts he think are most important to fix. 
1. Soft the technical dept issues to get a priority list.

## Sprint Closures
### Simple Question
Write down 'one thing that I learned last sprint' or 'One awesome thing someone did for me last sprint'

### Kudo Card Wall
Ask people to write a Kudo card. Make sure you give one or more Kudo cards (TODO: work out Kudo card. Basically card with Kudo or Congratulations on it).
